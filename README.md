# PROG1-UOL24
The Game Project was a great opportunity to learn JavaScript code. While all the parts of the project
had its challenges, adding the extensions to bring it all together required patience and logic. I
was able to implement all three extensions, therefore my game includes enemies, platforms
and sound. It was not easy at times trying to get the correct order of the code layout, but by
the time I was complete, it definitely made a lot of sense and I look forward to putting these
skills to use in the future.

One of the challenges I faced was getting the win confirmation to be displayed, after the
player had collected five coins and reached the flag. It required the addition of a simple “&&”
statement, which I was able to figure out after a bit of trial and error. Implementing the various
sounds was also a bit difficult as this had to be integrated throughout code previously done, to
allow for all the moving parts to align with the correct sound -based on the action by the
player.

Overall I was able to practise the use of variables, arrays, objects. It was truly a delight
learning how to use the factory pattern and the constructor function. When I look back at the
amount of time it took to code the game character compared to coding the enemies. I now
appreciate how much time and effort is saved by understanding good coding techniques.
